# Admin Configuration

# NOTE: DON'T use TAB characters in yaml files, use spaces to indent!

# This file can contain three lists: one with elevated players with special permissions
# and one for each banned and muted players.

# 'Id' is a SteamID64 in all lists, lookup possible at https://steamid.io/
# 'Permission' is 3 for 'GameMaster', 6 for 'Moderator' and 9 for 'Admin' - other values are not allowed.
# 'Until' is the time when the ban or mute ends.
